I started by writing the 1s and 0s parser as instructed, but after doing that I
decided I wanted my program to be able to reliably tokenize a given file before
doing any of the actual syntax.

The reason I chose to do it this way is that I knew my testing strategy for the
Syntax was most likely going to involve writing some .nal files and running them.

Which wouldn't have been possible without sorting out all of the file reading
infrastructure.
